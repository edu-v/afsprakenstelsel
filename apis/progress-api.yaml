  title: Progress API
  version: '0.0.5'
  description: |-
    This API defines progress about specific learning materials (assignable Units) in the course to report to the `Leermiddelendashboard`. Main goal is to inform teachers on progress (which activities are completed) and possible indication that the activity was completed, but needs attention of the teacher. 

    Progress is reported on Learning materials on the level of Assignable Units within a Course in the Course API. 
    Progress is reported when an activity is started or completed, not while the activity is in progress. If the activity is adaptive and will take more time for one student due to adaptive levels, that is not reported.

    Activities have a life cycle of not-started, started, completed. The not started is the default and will not be reported, unless (for some reason) the status goes back to not-started. The abandoned state is to indicate that the activity was started, but will never be completed (optional).

    The API does not force the supplier of the learning material to use a standard for the indication about the quality of the progress. It is optional to indicate a signal and/or pleaseFollowUp to the `Leermiddelendashboard`.
    This provides the supplier a way to tell the Teacher via the `Leermiddelendashboard` that the progress was not standard and the Teacher is advised to have a look at the more detailed dashboard (with a direct url) within the `Gebruiksomgeving digitaal leermateriaal`.
    A supplier can provide any scale (1-10, average, good, bad) by adding this as text. The `Leermiddelendashboard` should not try to combine these indications for a complete chapter or paragraph.

    Consent is required to exchange Progress information from the `Gebruiksomgeving digitaal leermateriaal` to the `Leermiddelendashboard`.
