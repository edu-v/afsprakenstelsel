  title: Usage API
  version: '1.0.0'
  description: |
    The Usage API is implemented by the `Licentieregistratie` and `Aanspraakmanager`.
    The Usage API is used to report InitialActivations of digital learning materials to the `Aanspraakmanager`.
    
    InitialActivation information is being send via the message-confirmation transaction pattern.
    Therefore the consuming reference component `Aanspraakmanager` needs to implement endpoints te receive usage data.
    
    The `Licentieregistratie` is the source of Usage information and provides GET endpoints to the `Aanspraakmanager` and `Bestelomgeving leermiddelen` for support and billing reasons.
    Moreover, the `Leermiddelendashboard` is able to request Usage information for a school or a student at a school.
